1. Automated MySQL to Google Cloud SQL Migration with Agentic AI Orchestration

This repository contains an intelligent, automated framework for migrating legacy MySQL databases to Google Cloud SQL for MySQL. The solution leverages Google Cloud's native Database Migration Service (DMS) and is orchestrated by a multi-agent AI system built on the Autogen framework. It supports both one-time snapshot transfers and continuous data replication (CDC) strategies, aiming to minimize disruption, reduce operational overhead, and accelerate the transition to a fully managed cloud database environment.

The framework incorporates Google Cloud best practices for performance, security, and cost optimization, and utilizes specialized AI agents to streamline various phases of the migration lifecycle, including environment setup, schema conversion, data migration, validation, anomaly detection, and performance tuning.

 b. Architecture

The migration process is orchestrated by a central `Main Orchestrator` within the Autogen framework. This orchestrator coordinates a team of specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific aspect of the migration. These agents interact with various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services via their respective APIs and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., Gemini) for intelligent reasoning and dynamic code generation.

A critical aspect of the architecture is the presence of robust feedback loops, where monitoring and logging data from Cloud SQL flow back to the Anomaly Detection and Performance Optimization agents. This enables self-correction and continuous improvement throughout the migration lifecycle.


 3. Prerequisites

Before running the migration, ensure you have the following:

- Google Cloud Project: An active GCP project with billing enabled.
- GCP CLI: Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud` command-line tool) installed and authenticated.
- Service Account: A dedicated GCP service account with appropriate IAM permissions (see[Setup and Configuration]).
- Python: Python 3.9+ installed.
- Legacy MySQL Database: A running legacy MySQL instance with the `employees` sample dataset (or your own data) and necessary user privileges configured. Ensure binary logging is enabled for CDC migrations.
- `mysqldump` and `mysql` clients: Installed on the machine where the Autogen agents will run if local exports/imports are used (as shown in some code examples).
- Secret Manager: Gemini API key and database credentials securely stored in GCP Secret Manager.

 4. Setup and Configuration

        ```bash
        gcloud iam service-accounts keys create autogen-migration-key.json \
            --iam-account=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}
        ```
        Place `autogen-migration-key.json` in a secure location (e.g., outside the repository). Update `Config.GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` in `autogen_migration/config/settings.py` to point to this file.

4.  Configure `settings.py`:
    Edit `autogen_migration/config/settings.py` with your specific project details:

    ```python
    import os
    from google.cloud import secretmanager

    def get_secret(secret_id, project_id):
        client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
        name = f"projects/{project_id}/secrets/{secret_id}/versions/latest"
        response = client.access_secret_version(request={"name": name})
        return response.payload.data.decode("UTF-8")

    class Config:
        PROJECT_ID = os.getenv("GCP_PROJECT_ID", "your-gcp-project-id") // <--- UPDATE THIS
        REGION = os.getenv("GCP_REGION", "us-central1") // <--- UPDATE THIS
        LEGACY_MYSQL_HOST = os.getenv("LEGACY_MYSQL_HOST", "your-legacy-mysql-ip") // <--- UPDATE THIS (e.g., internal IP or public IP if securely whitelisted)
        LEGACY_MYSQL_PORT = os.getenv("LEGACY_MYSQL_PORT", "3306")
        LEGACY_MYSQL_DB = os.getenv("LEGACY_MYSQL_DB", "legacy_employees_db") // <--- UPDATE THIS
        CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_ID = os.getenv("CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_ID", "cloud-sql-employees-instance") // <--- UPDATE THIS
        CLOUD_SQL_DB_NAME = os.getenv("CLOUD_SQL_DB_NAME", "employees_db")
        CLOUD_SQL_MACHINE_TYPE = os.getenv("CLOUD_SQL_MACHINE_TYPE", "db-n1-standard-2")
        CLOUD_SQL_STORAGE_GB = int(os.getenv("CLOUD_SQL_STORAGE_GB", "20"))
        VPC_NETWORK_NAME = os.getenv("VPC_NETWORK_NAME", "default") // <--- UPDATE THIS if not using 'default' VPC
        
        // Retrieve sensitive credentials from Secret Manager (ENSURE THESE SECRETS EXIST)
        LEGACY_MYSQL_USER = get_secret("legacy-mysql-user", PROJECT_ID)
        LEGACY_MYSQL_PASSWORD = get_secret("legacy-mysql-password", PROJECT_ID)
        CLOUD_SQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = get_secret("cloud-sql-root-password", PROJECT_ID)
        GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH = os.getenv("GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH", "/path/to/your/autogen-migration-key.json") // <--- UPDATE THIS PATH
        
        // LLM Configuration
        LLM_CONFIG = {
            "model": "gemini-1.5-pro", // Or another suitable model
            "api_key": get_secret("gemini-api-key", PROJECT_ID), // <--- ENSURE THIS SECRET EXISTS
        }
    ```

5.  Populate GCP Secret Manager:
    Create the necessary secrets in Secret Manager:
     `legacy-mysql-user` (e.g., `root` or a dedicated migration user for your legacy MySQL)
     `legacy-mysql-password`
     `cloud-sql-root-password` (This will be the initial root password for the newly created Cloud SQL instance by the agent)
     `gemini-api-key` (Your API key for Google Gemini)

    Example using `gcloud` to create secrets:
    ```bash
    echo "your_legacy_mysql_user" | gcloud secrets create legacy-mysql-user --data-file=- --project=your-gcp-project-id
    echo "your_legacy_mysql_password" | gcloud secrets create legacy-mysql-password --data-file=- --project=your-gcp-project-id
    echo "your_cloud_sql_root_password" | gcloud secrets create cloud-sql-root-password --data-file=- --project=your-gcp-project-id
    echo "your_gemini_api_key" | gcloud secrets create gemini-api-key --data-file=- --project=your-gcp-project-id
    ```

 5. Running the Migration

The `main.py` script acts as the entry point for the Autogen orchestrator. When you run it, the `UserProxyAgent` (`Admin`) initiates a chat with the `GroupChatManager`, which then coordinates the specialized agents to execute the migration workflow.

1.  Set Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended):
    For deployment in GCP environments (e.g., Compute Engine, Cloud Run), it's best practice to set these as environment variables. For local testing, you can modify `main.py` or `settings.py` directly, but avoid hardcoding sensitive values.

    ```bash
    export GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
    export GCP_REGION="us-central1" // Or your desired region
    export LEGACY_MYSQL_HOST="your-legacy-mysql-ip"
    export LEGACY_MYSQL_DB="legacy_employees_db"
    export CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE_ID="cloud-sql-employees-instance"
    export GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH="/path/to/your/autogen-migration-key.json"
    ```

2.  Execute the Main Script:
    Navigate to the root of your cloned repository and run:

    ```bash
    python autogen_migration/main.py
    ```

    The `user_proxy` agent is configured with `human_input_mode="ALWAYS"`, meaning it will pause and prompt for your input/approval at various stages of the migration. Follow the prompts in your terminal.

 6. Agent Definitions and Roles

The framework consists of the following specialized Autogen agents:

 Environment Setup Agent: Automates the provisioning and initial configuration of GCP resources like Cloud SQL instances, VPC networks, and Cloud Storage buckets.
 Schema Conversion Agent: Analyzes the legacy MySQL schema for incompatibilities and generates DDL scripts for Cloud SQL, leveraging LLM for refactoring.
 Data Migration Agent: Orchestrates the actual data transfer, initiating DMS jobs for one-time or continuous replication (CDC).
 Data Validation Agent: Verifies data integrity and consistency between source and target using row counts, checksums, and sample comparisons.
 Anomaly Detection Agent: Monitors the migration and target Cloud SQL instance for errors, performance deviations, and unusual patterns using Cloud Monitoring and Logging.
 Performance Optimization Agent: Continuously monitors Cloud SQL performance and suggests/applies optimizations such as index improvements, configuration adjustments, and instance scaling.
 Main Orchestrator: Defines the overall migration workflow, manages communication, and handles decision-making based on agent outputs.

 7. Cost Considerations

Running this framework incurs costs related to various GCP components and LLM API usage. Key cost drivers and optimization techniques include:

 Cloud SQL for MySQL: Instance type, storage, backups. Optimize by right-sizing instances, utilizing Committed Use Discounts (CUDs), and scheduling downtime for non-critical environments.
 Database Migration Service (DMS): Homogeneous migrations (MySQL to Cloud SQL) are free for the service itself; heterogeneous migrations have tiered pricing based on data volume.
 Cloud Storage: For data dumps and backups. Choose appropriate storage classes (e.g., Nearline, Coldline, Archive) based on access frequency.
 Compute Engine (for Agents/VMs): Costs for running the Python scripts. Optimize with CUDs for long-running processes, Spot VMs for fault-tolerant tasks, and by powering off instances when not in use.
 Cloud Monitoring & Cloud Logging: Data ingestion and retention. Filter unnecessary logs and metrics to control costs.
 LLM API (e.g., Google Gemini): Charged per token for input and output. Optimize by choosing cost-effective models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Flash for simpler tasks), concise prompts, and caching where applicable.


 8. Troubleshooting

 Authentication Errors: Double-check your `GCP_PROJECT_ID` environment variable, the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` in `settings.py`, and ensure the service account has all required IAM permissions.
 Secret Manager Access Issues: Verify the `secret_id` values in `settings.py` match the secrets created in Secret Manager, and that the service account has `secretmanager.secretAccessor` role.
 MySQL Connectivity: Ensure your legacy MySQL instance is reachable from the GCP environment (correct IP, firewall rules, VPC peering).
 DMS Job Failures: Review DMS job logs in the Google Cloud Console for specific error messages. Check source MySQL binary logging configuration for CDC.
 Agent Errors/Hangs: Review logs generated by the agents in the `logs/` directory and the console output for Python tracebacks. The LLM `api_key` configuration is crucial.
 LLM Rate Limits: If encountering LLM API errors, consider if you're hitting rate limits. Optimize prompts and potentially implement back-off/retry logic.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Environment Setup Agent :

Purpose: This code defines an agent called EnvironmentSetupAgent that helps set up the necessary cloud infrastructure (specifically on Google Cloud Platform) for a data migration.
Inheritance: The agent is built upon ConversableAgent from the autogen library, which means it can participate in conversations with other agents.
Initialization: When the agent is created, it does a few things:
It initializes the ConversableAgent with a name and language model configuration.
It registers specific functions that it can perform, like creating Cloud SQL instances and Google Cloud Storage buckets.
It gets Google Cloud credentials using a service account key.
It sets up clients to interact with the Cloud SQL Admin API and the Google Cloud Storage API.
_create_cloud_sql_instance function: This is a function the agent can call to create a new Cloud SQL database instance.
It takes details like the project ID, instance ID, region, machine type, storage size, and a root password.
It constructs a request body with the desired configuration for the Cloud SQL instance (including settings for networking, backups, and database flags).
It uses the Cloud SQL Admin client to insert (create) the instance.
It waits for the creation operation to complete.
It returns a success status and the instance ID.
_create_gcs_bucket function: This function is used to create a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
It takes the project ID, bucket name, and region as input.
It checks if the bucket already exists.
If the bucket doesn't exist, it creates it with the specified location.
If the bucket already exists, it logs a message indicating that.
It returns a success status and the bucket name.
Registered Functions: The agent registers these creation functions (_create_cloud_sql_instance and _create_gcs_bucket) so they can be triggered by other agents or the orchestrator during a conversation.
Potential Additions: The code includes comments suggesting that more functions for setting up other infrastructure components like VPC peering and IAM (Identity and Access Management) could be added.
Example Usage: The commented-out code at the end shows how this agent might be used in a larger system (like a main script or orchestrator) to request the creation of cloud resources.

Schema Conversion Agent :

Purpose: This code defines an agent called SchemaConversionAgent that is responsible for handling the database schema during a data migration. Its main job is to get the schema from the original database, potentially modify it for compatibility with the target database (Cloud SQL in this case), and then apply the converted schema to the target database.
Inheritance: Like the EnvironmentSetupAgent, this agent also inherits from ConversableAgent from the autogen library, allowing it to engage in conversations and workflows with other agents.
Initialization: When a SchemaConversionAgent is created, it:
Initializes the ConversableAgent with its name and language model configuration.
Registers specific functions related to schema handling: exporting the legacy schema, analyzing and converting the schema, and applying the converted schema to Cloud SQL.
_export_legacy_schema function: This function is designed to extract the database schema from the original (legacy) MySQL database.
It takes connection details for the legacy database (host, port, user, password, database name) and an optional output file path.
It calls a utility function (export_mysql_schema) to perform the actual schema export to an SQL file.
It returns a success status and the path to the generated schema file.
_analyze_and_convert_schema function: This is the core function for schema conversion.
It takes the path to the exported legacy schema file.
It reads the content of the schema file.
LLM Interaction (Conceptual): The code includes comments indicating where an interaction with a Language Model (LLM) would typically occur for complex schema conversions. The idea is that the LLM would analyze the legacy schema and generate a new schema definition that is compatible with the target database (Cloud SQL).
Simple Conversion (Example): For demonstration purposes, the code includes a simple example of a schema conversion: replacing "DEFINER=root@localhost" with "SQL SECURITY INVOKER". This is a common adjustment needed for some MySQL features when moving to other environments like Cloud SQL.
It writes the potentially converted schema to a new file (data/employees_schema_cloudsql.sql).
It returns a success status and the path to the converted schema file.
_apply_cloud_sql_schema function: This function applies the converted schema to the target Cloud SQL database.
It takes connection details for the Cloud SQL database and the path to the converted schema file.
It calls a utility function (import_mysql_dump) to execute the SQL commands in the converted schema file on the Cloud SQL database.
It returns a success status and a confirmation message.
Registered Functions: The agent makes these three schema-related functions available for use in conversations or workflows.
Example Usage: The commented-out code at the end shows how this agent could be used in an orchestrator or main script to perform the entire schema conversion process.

It creates a ConnectionProfile object with the provided information.
It uses the DMS client to create the connection profile in Google Cloud.
It waits for the operation to complete.
It returns a success status and the ID of the created profile.
_create_dms_migration_job function: This function defines a migration job within DMS, specifying what data to move and where to move it.
It takes details like the project ID, region, a job ID, the source connection profile ID, and the ID of the target Cloud SQL instance.
It allows specifying the type of migration (e.g., "ONE_TIME" for a single transfer or "CONTINUOUS" for ongoing replication).
It creates a MigrationJob object, linking the source profile to the target Cloud SQL instance.
It uses the DMS client to create the migration job.
It waits for the operation to complete.
It returns a success status and the ID of the created job.
_start_dms_migration_job function: This function initiates the data migration process.
It takes the project ID, region, and the ID of the migration job to start.
It uses the DMS client to send the "start" command for the specified job.
It waits for the operation to complete (though the actual data transfer might still be ongoing).
It returns a success status and the ID of the started job.
_monitor_dms_job function: This function allows checking the status of a running migration job.
It takes the project ID, region, and the ID of the job to monitor.
It repeatedly calls the DMS client to get the current state of the migration job.
It logs the current state and waits for a short period (30 seconds) before checking again.
The loop continues until the job reaches a final state (e.g., completed successfully, failed).
It logs the final state of the job.
It returns the final state of the job and the job ID.
Registered Functions: These four functions are registered to be used by the agent in conversations and workflows.
Example Usage: The commented-out code shows how this agent could be used in an orchestrator to set up and start a data migration using DMS.

Data Validation Agent :

Purpose: This code defines a DataValidationAgent which is responsible for verifying that the data migration was successful and that the data in the target database (Cloud SQL) matches the data in the source database (legacy MySQL).

It compares the row counts.
It logs whether the counts match or mismatch and returns a dictionary indicating the status and the counts.
It closes both database connections.
_compare_checksums function: This function compares the checksums of a table in both databases. A checksum is a value calculated based on the data in the table, which can be used to quickly check if the data is likely the same.
It takes database configuration dictionaries for both databases and the table name.
It connects to both databases.
It executes a CHECKSUM TABLE query on the table in both databases.
It compares the checksum values.
It logs the result of the comparison and returns a dictionary with the status and checksums.

It takes database configuration dictionaries for both databases, the table name, and the desired sample size.
It uses the _get_db_data helper function to retrieve data from both databases.
It takes a random sample of rows from each DataFrame.
Comparison (Simple Example): The code includes a simple comparison by converting the sampled DataFrames to dictionaries and checking for mismatches. The comment indicates that a more robust deep comparison would be needed in a real-world scenario.
It logs whether the sample data matches or if mismatches are found.
It returns a dictionary with the status and information about any mismatches.
Registered Functions: These three validation functions are registered to be used by the agent in conversations and workflows.
Example Usage: The commented-out code shows how this agent could be used in an orchestrator to initiate data validation after a migration.

Anamoly Detection Agent :

Purpose: This code defines an AnomalyDetectionAgent designed to monitor the health and identify potential issues (anomalies) in the target Cloud SQL database instance, especially after or during a data migration.

It retrieves recent CPU and memory utilization metrics for the instance using utility functions that interact with the Cloud Monitoring API.
Simple Anomaly Detection: It includes a basic check for high CPU usage (above 90%) and high memory usage (above 90%) as simple indicators of potential anomalies.
It compiles a list of detected anomalies.
If anomalies are found, it logs a warning and returns a status indicating anomalies were detected, along with details.
If no significant anomalies are found based on these metrics, it logs an info message and returns a "no_anomalies" status.
_analyze_logs_for_errors function: This function examines the Cloud SQL logs for error messages that might indicate problems.
It takes the project ID and instance ID.
It retrieves recent logs from the Cloud SQL instance, specifically filtering for logs with a severity of "ERROR" or "CRITICAL" within the last hour.
If error logs are found, it logs a warning, includes a sample of the logs, and returns a status indicating errors were found, along with the count and sample logs.
LLM Interaction (Conceptual): The code includes a commented-out line suggesting where an LLM could be used to analyze the log patterns for a deeper understanding of the root cause of errors.
If no error logs are found, it logs an info message and returns a "no_errors" status.
Registered Functions: These two functions (_monitor_cloud_sql_health and _analyze_logs_for_errors) are registered for use by the agent.
Example Usage: The commented-out code shows how this agent might be used in an orchestrator to request health monitoring and log analysis for a Cloud SQL instance.

Performance Optimization Agent :

Purpose: This code defines a PerformanceOptimizationAgent focused on analyzing the performance of the target Cloud SQL database instance and suggesting or applying optimizations to improve its efficiency.

It creates a performance report dictionary summarizing the average utilization and potentially other metrics.
It logs the performance report and returns it.
_recommend_optimizations function: This function provides recommendations for optimizing the Cloud SQL instance based on the performance report.
It takes the performance report dictionary as input.
LLM Interaction (Conceptual): The code includes a comment indicating where an LLM could be used to generate more sophisticated recommendations based on a comprehensive performance report.
Simple Recommendations: It includes basic rules for suggesting optimizations based on average CPU utilization (suggesting more vCPUs or query optimization if over 70%) and average memory utilization (suggesting more memory or buffer pool optimization if over 80%).
It compiles a list of recommendations.
If no specific issues are detected based on these simple rules, it suggests that performance is currently good.
It logs the recommendations and returns them.
_apply_instance_scaling function: This function allows the agent to directly scale the Cloud SQL instance by changing its machine type (CPU) and memory.
It takes the project ID, instance ID, the desired number of vCPUs, and the desired memory in GB.
It constructs a request body to update the instance settings with the new tier (machine type) and memory limit.
It uses the Cloud SQL Admin client to patch (update) the instance with the new settings.
